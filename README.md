# Linear Regression
This project is an implementation of linear regression with linear regression, Ridge, and Lasso from Sklearn to predict the price of flight prices based on their features. The model is trained on a dataset of 8546 pieces of data and is able to predict the price of flights with a root mean squared error of 3.46.
